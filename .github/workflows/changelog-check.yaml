  # Count the number of commits in a pull request. This can be
  # disabled by adding a trailer line of the following form to the
  # pull request message:
  #
  #    Disable-Check: changelog-update
  #
  # The check is case-insensitive and ignores other contents on the
  # line as well, so it is possible to add several different checks if
  # that is necessary.
  #
  # It is assumed that the trailer is following RFC2822 conventions,
  # but this is currently not enforced.
